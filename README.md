This Task Manager Web Application is a full-stack project built using the MERN stack  
(MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js).  
It was developed as part of a software development internship.  

The app allows users to manage tasks with features like:  
- Create, edit, delete tasks  
- Task status tracking (Pending, In Progress, Completed)  
- Search and filter functionality  
- Optional user authentication using JWT  
- Responsive UI with clean design  

The project follows best practices in backend API design, frontend development,  
and code organization with a modular, scalable structure.
